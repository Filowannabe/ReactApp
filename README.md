# React Project Template

This repository contains a template for a React project. This template contains all the necessary libraries, tools and configurations to start a new React project. Some libraries are left to the developer to decide which ones to use, like the UI library.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18
- npm

  > npm can be replaced by yarn, or pnpm but the commands in this README will be using npm. You'd need to remove the `package-lock.json` file and run your install command with the package manager of your choice.

### Useful Commands

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone ${REPO_URL}
```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the development server in port 4000 with HMR enabled. You can access the application.


## Libraries

The following libraries are included in this template:
